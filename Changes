1.17  Fri Nov 21 08:12:54 2003
	- Changed the grammar slightly, so that if a particular
	  key/value pair does not have the value defined, it will
	  still correctly parse the ini file
	    - This idea was inspired by the following node on
	      PerlMonks: http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=308716
